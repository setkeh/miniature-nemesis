> Steve Jobs‘ yacht was unveiled in a Dutch shipyard on Sunday, where the unusual boat designed by Jobs and famed minimalist designer Philippe Starck was christened “Venus,” after the Roman goddess of love, beauty, sex, fertility, prosperity and victory.

I love the design of this yacht. Really sleek and minimalist.

description: How I setup this blog and what I use to run it
---
So, I've just finished up setting up this brand new blog. Before I've always run a WordPress blog, but since WordPress is kind of over-kill with all it features that I don't need, I've decided to try something new, so this time I am running a static blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

So the Big Question is 

DOES IT FUCKING WORK
====================

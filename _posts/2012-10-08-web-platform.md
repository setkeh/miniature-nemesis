Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Google, HP, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia, and Opera have joined the W3C to launch a new website called ‘[Web Platform](http://webplatform.org/)‘.

This new website will serve a a single source of relevant, up-to-date and quality information on the latest HTML5, CSS3, and other Web standards, offering tips on web development and best practises for the technologies.

Hopefully this will be the end of [W3Schools](http://http://www.w3schools.com/).

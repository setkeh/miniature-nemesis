I have been looking for some time to get notifications from my Evo 3D to my PC because i have a bad habbit of leaving it in the lounge room or office when i get busy around the house or leaving it on silent so it doesenteven viberate when i get home from tafe, This App nullifies my noob in these situations because after yu have setup some basic stuff it will notify you about Phone Calls, TxT Messages, even battery state.
The setup is Incredibly Simple and as easy as pointing and clicking for the most part it even supports encrypting the notifications if you were using it on a public network.

{% highlight sh %}
Things i Have Tested and Work:
Wifi Notifications
Bluetooth Notifications
Wifi Broadcasting (Great for reciving notifications on more that one PC within a network)
Dbus Notification Support with the Naughty Library in Awesome (Needs a bit of tweaking)
{% endhighlight %}

And So far im super impressed with the functionallity and stability of the application and its PC Clients and is S.A.N.E Notification Method.

I rate this app a Perfect 10/10 for simplicity tonns of options and fantastic usability i highly recommend giving this app a shot :D

As of today, Apple's failed music-focused social network, Ping, is officially closed.

>There are a lot of reasons why Ping failed, the biggest of which was probably the lack of Facebook integration when the service launched. Back in 2010, the word was that Apple was [forced to pull Facebook](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/02/all-things-d-facebook-blocked-apples-ping-service-for-unauthor/) from the service at the last minute, leaving the service handicapped. Without the backing of the world's biggest social network, the service never achieved critical mass â€” in fact, the only positive mention of Ping that we can find came right after launch, when Apple bragged of [one million sign-ups](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/03Ping-Users-Top-One-Million-in-First-48-Hours.html) in 24 hours.
